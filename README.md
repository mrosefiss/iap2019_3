# Bus Lane Evaluation
This code has two parts: 1) The prepping of data, done in an iPython notebook, and 2) The creation of an interactive visualization, done in R with Shiny.

The data was provided by the class but came from AVL data for buses on Routes 1, 71, and 73 in the Boston area. I include an output of the prepped data so that the R code can be run easily. The goal is to understand the impact of bus lanes on travel speed and travel time variability. The visualization allows the user to specify the route, direction, and time of day, and see the distribution of travel times before and after the bus lane was implemented.
